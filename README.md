# SolSecurity MCP: Advanced Solana Wallet Security Analysis

## üö® Why You Need This Tool Right Now

In the rapidly evolving world of Web3, security threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Recent statistics show that over $1.7 billion was lost to crypto scams in 2023 alone, with address poisoning and dusting attacks being among the most prevalent threats. These attacks are particularly dangerous because they're often invisible to the untrained eye and can lead to devastating financial losses.

### Real-World Impact: The $2.9 Million Address Poisoning Attack

In November 2023, a single user lost over $2.9 million in a sophisticated address poisoning attack. The attacker created an address that looked nearly identical to the user's frequently used address, and the user, thinking they were sending to a trusted address, transferred their funds to the attacker's wallet. This devastating loss could have been prevented with proper address verification and real-time security analysis.

### The Growing Threat

1. **Address Poisoning Attacks**: Attackers create addresses that look similar to your frequently used addresses, hoping you'll accidentally send funds to the wrong address. These attacks are becoming more sophisticated, with attackers using advanced techniques to make their addresses look legitimate.

2. **Dusting Attacks**: Attackers send tiny amounts of tokens to your wallet to track your transactions and potentially link your addresses to your identity. This can lead to targeted phishing attacks or more sophisticated scams.

### Why Traditional Security Measures Aren't Enough

- Most wallet interfaces only show basic transaction information
- Manual address verification is error-prone and time-consuming
- Existing security tools often lack real-time analysis capabilities
- Many users don't realize they've been targeted until it's too late

## üõ°Ô∏è What SolSecurity MCP Does

   - Provides detailed analysis of potential threats

2. **Comprehensive Dusting Analysis**
   - Detects dust transactions from known malicious addresses
   - Analyzes transaction patterns for suspicious activity
   - Provides detailed reports on potential threats
   - Helps prevent identity linking attacks

3. **Real-time Risk Assessment**

## üîß Usage

### For Individual Users

Simply provide your wallet address, and SolSecurity MCP will analyze your transactions for potential threats:

```python
from src.mcp_tools.poisoning_tool import check_wallet_poisoning
from src.mcp_tools.dusting_tool import check_wallet_dusting

# Check for poisoning attacks
poisoning_results = check_wallet_poisoning("your_wallet_address")

# Check for dusting attacks
dusting_results = check_wallet_dusting("your_wallet_address")
```

### For Service Providers

Integrate SolSecurity MCP into your applications to provide real-time security analysis:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/check_wallet_poisoning \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"wallet_address": "your_wallet_address"}'
```

## üìä Example Results

```json
{
  "wallet_address": "your_wallet_address",
  "total_transactions": 50,
  "high_risk_count": 2,
  "medium_risk_count": 5,
  "medium_low_risk_count": 8,
  "clean_count": 35,
  "transaction_details": [
    {
